# Form Tools

## What Are they

Tools are plugins that can be added to EditorJS. They are used to add functionality, such as adding a list or an image. In our case we are building custom tools to inject special form inputs into the editor.

Custom tools give us the flexibility to create and store blocks in EditorJS in any way we want.

## Creating a Custom Tool

To create custom tools, you'll need to make use of the `createEditorJsPlugin` function. It accepts an object called `toolbox` which contains the title of the tool that will be shown in the Editor menus, the icon that will be displayed.
It also accepts a `configuration` options object,`initialData`, and a `component`. See more configuration info in the official docs [EditorJS](https://editorjs.io/the-first-plugin/).

`initialData` will be used to set the initial data props for the component.

Note: Each tool should make use of the `value` prop. This is what gets serialized on request to OpenAI when the form is submitted.

```ts
export default createEditorJsPlugin<Props>
  {
    toolbox: {
      title: "Input",
      icon: "<svg>...</svg>",
    },
    configuration: { readOnly: true },
    initialData: { value: "", ... },
    component: YourNewToolComponent,
  };
```

The component should accept a `dispatchData` function and call that whenever the input changes.
This dispatches a change to the EditorJS data allowing us to fetch the updated data on EditorJS `save()`.

## Adding The Tool to the Editor

To add the tool to the editor, navigate to the `EditorContext.tsx` file under `useEditorController` and add the tool (the exported `createEditorJsPlugin` created) in the tools object

```ts
useEffect(() => {
    editorRef.current = new EditorJS({
        ...
        tools: {
            ...
            YourNewTool: YourNewTool
            ...
        }
    })
    ...
}, [])
```

## Ensuring the Tool Can Be Swapped with Normal Text

A tool like an input or a dropdown tool should have the ability to get a highlighted value from the Paragraph inputs and inject that data into the swapped tool. `createBlockFromText` let's us do that.

Add the toolname for your tool in the switch case and handle massaging the `value` to match your tool's data.

```ts
export function createBlockFromText(blockType: string, value: string) {
 let returnValue = []
 ...
 switch (blockType) {
    ...
    case "YourNewTool":
      returnValue = [blockType, { value: value, placeholder: "", label: "" }];
      break;
      ...
 }
 return returnValue;
}
```

## Preview a Tool in storybook

To preview a tool in storybook, export the component (not the plugin creation component) and create a story for it.
